Crime Prediction Using Chicago Crime Data

OBJECTIVE:

For our project, we have taken Crimes in Chicago and are trying to perform data mining techniques to predict some insights based on the data.
 

DATA SOURCE:

Chicago Crimes:
	https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2

The Data is from the official Chicago Data Portal and is provided by the Chicago police 
department. The data has details of the crimes reported from 2001 to present and has about 
7.42M rows. For our mining purposes we have filtered data from the year 2018 -2020.

Population Data:
	https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Chicago-PopulationCounts/85cm-7uqa/data

The Dataset has the population counts of the Chicago city according to the age. The 
data is taken from the official portal as well and must be correlated with the crime data.


BUSINESS PROBLEM TO ADDRESS â€“ OBJECTIVE:

We are a consulting agency for a Real Estate company. The Real Estate Company who wants to buy houses around Chicago, approached us with the crime data of Chicago to get insight of how safe a neighbourhood/community will be, so they can invest wisely and have this as a selling strategy to boost up their selling prices and increase profits.


OUR APPROACH:

With the crime data they provide for Chicago and with the population data we have in hand for the respective district, we find the number of crimes that will happen based on the community and will predict the population increase for that community, for the forthcoming year. With these predictions we can find how likely a person in that community be a victim of the crimes happening there. The real estate company will take up the list of neighbourhoodswith the least crime rate to invest.
